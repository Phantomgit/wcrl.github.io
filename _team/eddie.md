Hey my name is Edward Nunez but I usually just go by Eddie. Iâ€™m a sophomore majoring in Mechanical Engineering and became interested with WCRL during my freshman year as a result of previous robotics experience. On my free time I like to CAD up some models, 3D print, play video games, lift, or go out for a drive!
