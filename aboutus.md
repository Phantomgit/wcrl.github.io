## Executive Board
The executive board forms the leadership of WCRL. They are in charge of logistics, organization and any future projects that help expand WCRL.

## League Coordinator
The league coordinators are in charge of bridging the gap between the the executive board and the general body of WCRL. They send out the monthly newsletters and are in charge of the social media as well.

## Build Technicians
Build Technicians form the heart and soul of WCRL. They are the elite squad in charge of helping you guys design, build, and debug (yay!) your robots.

## Freshman Ambassadors
Fresman Ambassadors are the newbies to WCRL. During their first semester they will compete in the semesterly tournament (just like you) and will slowly be more integreated into the E-board.
