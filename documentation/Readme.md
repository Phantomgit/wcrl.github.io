# ReadME

There are two different sets of code for Bot Control on the Arduino Platform. Due to lack of updates by Dabble, iPhones on iOS 16+ will need to utilize the BitBlue code.

## BitBlue

Note: Pressing and holding does NOT function properly. This is a design conflict in the
BitBlue application. Instead, pressing the button once will trigger an action. Pressing
the button again will end that action.

Controls:

- Forward Arrow: Move Bot Forward
- Back Arrow: Move Bot in Reverse
- Left Arrow: Move Bot to the Left
- Right Arrow: Move Bot to the Right
- A: Competition Attachment at Low Speed
- X: Competition Attachment at High Speed
